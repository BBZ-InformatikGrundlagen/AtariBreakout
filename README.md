# About The Project
Welcome to the Atari Breakout project for the micro:bit! This project allows you to play the classic Atari game on your micro:bit and an external display with an SPI interface.

## Built With
[Lancaster University](https://lancaster-university.github.io/microbit-docs/)

## Requirements
To get started, you will need the following:
* A micro:bit board
* An external display with an SPI interface, such as an OLED display

## Getting Started
* Download the `MicrobitFile.hex` files from the repository.
* Connect the external display to the micro:bit using the SPI interface.
* Connect your micro:bit to your computer using a USB cable.
* Upload the code from your computer to your micro:bit.

## Playing the game
To play the game, simply use the buttons to control the paddle.

The left button moves the paddle left, while the right button moves the paddle right. Use the paddle to bounce the ball back up to the bricks and try to clear the level. The game will be displayed on the external display.

## Troubleshooting
If you have any issues getting the game to work, here are a few things to try:
* Double-check that the code is correctly uploaded to the micro:bit.
* Check that the external display is properly connected to the micro:bit and functioning correctly.
*Try resetting the micro:bit by pressing the reset button.

If you continue to have issues, feel free to reach out for support or check the project's repository for any updates or known issues.
